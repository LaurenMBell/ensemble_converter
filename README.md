This is a bioinformatics practice project of Lauren Bell's. It 
is a very small package that can convert a gene's Ensembl ID to it's
respective symbol via the Biomart API. She might add more functionality 
later. Who knows. 

To install this package, use this command: python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps ensembl_converter
