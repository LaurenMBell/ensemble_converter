This is a bioinformatics practice project of Lauren Bell's. It 
is a very small package that can convert a gene's Ensembl ID to it's
respective symbol via the Biomart API. She might add more functionality 
later. Who knows. 

I used this tutorial for making the base package: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
